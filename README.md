# stockTikkerTwilio
This python code fetches changes in stock market from nsetools library and sends twilio message to my mobile 

About
------
With the stock market rapidly changing on a day-to-day basis and many budding investors using mobile applications such as Robinhood to trade, it is imperative to constantly stay updated, or risk being left behind. That’s precisely why I created this quick Python program that can send me live stock data directly to my phone for easy access.

In the movie Wall Street, one dimension of the main character Gordon Gecko that the film disappointingly fails to explore is his love of the outdoors.  That’s right, he loves to go camping.  Unexpected, right?
Gordon’s never going to get a data connection out there, but with a bit of Python and Twilio SMS he can still check his stock prices with only a few of those precious reception bars.  Let’s find out how.
